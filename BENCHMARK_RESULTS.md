### Detailed Results by Image

#### Smooth-shaded models (69 distinct colors, ~99.7% switches/run)

**thumbnail_1_thumb.png:** 22.4% fill, 9,216 px
- Naive: 4,130 frames, 13.75s
- Bucket-sort: 1,552 frames, 5.20s → **2.64× speedup**
- Analysis: Smooth per-vertex shading produces nearly one color change per RLE run. Bucket-sort reduces palette sets from 1,483 down to 69 (one per distinct color).

**thumbnail_2_thumb.png:** 20.7% fill, 9,216 px
- Naive: 3,810 frames, 12.60s
- Bucket-sort: 1,281 frames, 4.29s → **2.94× speedup**
- Analysis: Similar smooth shading. Bucket-sort sends palette only 69 times instead of ~1,200 times.

#### Faceted models (8–10 colors, ~98% switches/run)

**thumbnail_3_thumb.png:** 34.0% fill, 9,216 px (regenerated from user source)
- Naive: 6,268 frames, 20.84s
- Bucket-sort: 1,375 frames, 4.67s → **4.46× speedup**
- Analysis: More filled model (34% vs 20%), but only 10 colors. More palette reuse across the image → larger bucket-sort win.

**thumbnail_4_thumb.png:** 19.4% fill, 9,216 px
- Naive: 3,584 frames, 11.87s
- Bucket-sort: 588 frames, 1.98s → **5.99× speedup**
- Analysis: Minimal color palette (8 colors), sparse model. Extreme bucket-sort win because palette is sent only 8 times total.

**thumbnail_5_thumb.png:** 17.1% fill, 9,216 px
- Naive: 3,146 frames, 10.53s
- Bucket-sort: 643 frames, 2.15s → **4.90× speedup**
- Analysis: Similar to #4 (8 colors, sparse), confirms consistent ~5× speedup for minimal palettes.

## Comparative Analysis

| Algorithm      | Avg speedup | Frame reduction | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Naive**      | 1.00×       | baseline        | Per-pixel `0x40` set-palette + `0x5B` rect = 2 frames/px |
| **RLE**        | 1.47×       | 32% avg         | Smooth models: collapses pixel runs, still palette-heavy (1 per run) |
| **Bucket-sort**| **4.19×**   | **76% avg**     | All models: groups runs by color; palette sent only #colors times |

## Wall Time Analysis

**Observed:** Wall times scale linearly with frame count (not wire-bound).
- Naive: 3,146–6,268 frames × ~3.36ms/frame ≈ 10.6–21.0s  
- Bucket-sort: 588–1,552 frames × ~3.42ms/frame ≈ 2.0–5.3s  

The consistent ~3.4ms/frame (slightly higher than the 3ms throttle) accounts for serial transmission time (~24 bytes per frame at 115200 baud = ~2.1ms) + panel processing overhead.

**Speedup scales with palette reduction, not just frame count:**
- Smooth-shaded models (69 colors): 2.6–2.9× speedup (palette sent 1,200+ → 69 times)
- Faceted models (8–10 colors): 4.5–6.0× speedup (palette sent 600+ → 8 times)

## Design Validation

1. ✅ **Panel is not wire-bound at 115200 baud.** Reducing frame count by 76% directly reduced wall time by 76%, with no buffering or queueing artifacts. The panel processes drawing commands in real time, keeping up with the serial stream.

2. ✅ **Palette switching is the dominant bottleneck.** Confirmed across 5 real thumbnails with different color palettes:
   - Smooth 69-color models: palette on 99%+ of runs → 2.6–2.9× bucket-sort win
   - Faceted 8-color models: palette on ~98% of runs → 5–6× bucket-sort win
   - RLE alone (28–37% reduction) consistently underperforms bucket-sort by nearly 2–3×, proving the cost is one palette-set per run, not pixel count or rect throughput.

3. ✅ **3ms/frame is a safe, conservative delay.** Used after the overrun incident (unthrottled ~2000-command flood wedged the panel). This delay was not bisected; tighter timing may be possible but 3ms is proven safe and reliable on all 5 real images with zero corruption.

4. ✅ **Real thumbnail speedup matches the model predictions perfectly.** Frame-count reduction and wall-time reduction stay within 1% of each other, confirming that panel processing time (not transmission time) is the real constraint.

## Implications for Phase 3

**Decision: Port bucket-sort into Marlin, not plain RLE.**

Bucket-sort costs ~6 KB RAM on a 96×96 image (holding the full run list before rendering), which is comfortable on the STM32F401 (256 KB SRAM). The speedup (4.2× average, 2.6–6.0× range) is decisively worth the cost, and the memory is released immediately after rendering.

The 4.2× speedup reduction in rendering time translates directly to a proportional reduction in how much print time is spent on UI updates — a real win for throughput, especially on faster printers.

**Algorithm for Phase 3:**
1. Decode the thumbnail image line-by-line (unchanged).
2. Collect all runs (x0, x1, y) into color buckets as they're generated (new).
3. Render each bucket (one palette set via `0x40`, then all its runs via `0x5B`) instead of row-by-row (new).
4. Keep the existing `color == 0` (transparent-black) skip (unchanged).
5. Apply 3ms/frame throttle in the DWIN frame-send helper, not per-call (new; matches Phase 1 finding).
6. Use a quantized palette during thumbnail decode if needed to keep distinct-color count under ~32 (optional optimization).
